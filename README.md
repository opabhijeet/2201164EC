# Backend Documentation

## Overview
This backend leverages efficient data structures and optimization techniques to ensure fast and reliable API responses. Key strategies include the use of heaps, cronjobs, and caching mechanisms.

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Heaps for Reducing API Response Time**  
    Heaps are utilized to efficiently manage and retrieve prioritized data. By maintaining a min-heap or max-heap structure, the backend can quickly access the most relevant or least relevant data, significantly reducing the time complexity of certain operations and improving API response times.

2. **Cronjob for Reducing Computation Overhead**  
    A scheduled cronjob is implemented to precompute and update data at regular intervals. This ensures that the backend is not burdened with heavy computations during API requests, allowing for faster responses.

3. **Caching for Quick Data Retrieval**  
    Frequently accessed data is cached to minimize redundant computations and database queries. This caching mechanism ensures that the backend can serve repeated requests with minimal latency.

### 2. **POST /api/update**
    - **Description**: Updates the data and rebalances the heap structure.
    - **Response**: Returns a success message upon successful update.
    - **Screenshot Placeholder**:

### 3. **GET /api/cache-status**
    - **Description**: Provides the current status of the cache and its contents.
    - **Response**: Returns a JSON object with cache details.
    - **Screenshot Placeholder**:  
      _Insert screenshot of response here._

## Notes
- Ensure the cronjob is running as scheduled to maintain optimal performance.
- Monitor the cache size and eviction policy to prevent memory overflows.
